                    <p> Just like your body, the brain ages and deteriorates with time. One thing less known is that its
                        aging begins around the age of 30, and the changes are often irreversible. Brain aging is not a
                        process that can be stopped, but it is one that can be delayed by various methods. This website
                        aims to inform about the ways you can take care of your brain and keep it healthy a longer time.

                        <p>People are born with basic survival skills, reflexes and around 100 billion neurons. The
                            brain grows rapidly during these early years. A child's brain has twice as many synapses as
                            an adult's brain. </p>

                        <p>At this point the brain reaches its adult weight of about three pounds. Increased activity in
                            the frontal lobes allows a teenager to compare several concepts at once. </p>

                        <p>The regions in the frontal lobe that are responsible for judgment, planning, weighing risks
                            and decision-making finally finish developing. A twenty-something's brain has reached its
                            peak in terms of performance. </p>

                        <p>Reasoning, spatial skills and speed of thought begin to decline around now. As you age, the
                            brain goes through changes that can slow down your thinking. </p>

                        <p>Starting at around age 40, people tend to remember positive images more than negative ones -
                            a trend that continues until at least age 80. </p>

                            moral decision-making, regulating emotions and reading social situations - have been shown

                            age, and most individuals with the disease are 65 or older. </p>

                            with aging, many experts think that genes and lifestyle contribute to the majority of

                        <hr>
                        <p>Brain aging is a natural process. It refers to the losing of synapses and neurons and the
                            shrinking of the brain matter after a certain age. In some cases neurodegenerative diseases
                            can develop. Brain aging usually starts around the age of 30. </p>

                        <hr>
                        <p>Neurodegenerative disease is an umbrella term for a range of conditions which primarily
                            affect the neurons in the human brain. Examples of neurodegenerative diseases include
                            Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and Huntington’s disease. </p>

                        <hr>
                        <p>No, unfortunately we cannot stop brain aging, but it has been shown in multiple researches
                            that we can slow down the process by following a simple set of rulles. </p>

                        <p>As Roger Anunsen (TED Talk bellow) said, one of the biggest risks in our near future, if we
                            don't take care of our brain, is our body outliving the brain. </p>

                        <p>We can take care of our brain and keep it young for a longer time by living a healthy and

                        <p>As with everything, it's better if we start at an early age but it's never too late to start
