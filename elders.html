                    <p> Just like your body, the brain ages and deteriorates with time. One thing less known is that its
                        aging begins around the age of 30, and the changes are often irreversible. Brain aging is not a
                        process that can be stopped, but it is one that can be delayed by various methods. This website
                        aims to inform about the ways you can take care of your brain and keep it healthy a longer time.

                        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
                        <p>The brain is one of the most important organs in our body. Despite that fact people don't
                            usually think about keeping it healthy or when they do it's too late and there isn't much
                            left to do. In this section you will find basic information about the brain, since birth to
                            60's. </p>
                        <h2>60's</h2>
                        <p>The brain has begun to shrink in size and, after a lifetime of gaining accumulated knowledge,
                            it becomes less efficient at accessing that knowledge and adding to it. The greatest risk
                            factor for Alzheimer's is advancing age, and most individuals with the disease are 65 or
                            older. Surprisingly, when Alzheimer's hits people in their 60s and 70s, they show faster
                            rates of brain tissue loss and cognitive decline compared to patients 80 years and older,
                            according to researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine.
                            Researchers aren't sure why Alzheimer's is more aggressive in younger patients, but suspect
                            that people who develop symptoms later in life may have milder cases - or cases that that
                            take longer to reveal themselves.</p>
                        <h2>70's and 80's</h2>
                        <p>Your risk of developing Alzheimer's increases with age, reaching 50 percent by age 85.
                            Researchers aren't sure why the risk jumps so dramatically as we get older, but it's
                            possible the disease is linked to inflammation, a natural part of aging that can lead to a
                            build-up of deposits in areas like the hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for
                            forming new memories. These deposits may also interfere with long-term memory. Along with
                            aging, many experts think that genes and lifestyle contribute to the majority of Alzheimer's
                            and dementia cases.</p>

                        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
                        <p>When it comes to brain health, there's a simple set of rulles for everyone.</p>
                        <h2>Avoid smoking, drinking and taking drugs</h2>
                        <p>Brain scans revealed that current and former smokers had a thinner cortex than those who
                            never smoked. The cortex is where important thought processes such as memory, language and
                            perception occur. <br> <br> According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and
                            Alcoholism, most heavy long-term alcohol users will experience a mild to moderate impairment
                            of intellectual functioning as well as diminished brain size. <br> <br> Drugs can alter
                            important brain areas that are necessary for life-sustaining functions and can drive the
                            compulsive drug use that marks addiction. </p>
                        <h2>Protect your head</h2>
                        <p>Moderate to severe head injuries, even without diagnosed concussions, increase the risk of
                            cognitive impairment.</p>
                        <h2>Improve your diet</h2>
                        <p>Good nutrition can help your mind as well as your body. For example, people that eat a
                            Mediterranean style diet that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts, unsaturated oils
                            (olive oil) and plant sources of proteins are less likely to develop cognitive impairment
                            and dementia.</p>
                        <h2>Mental stimulation</h2>
                        <p>Through research with mice and humans, scientists have found that brainy activities stimulate
                            new connections between nerve cells and may even help the brain generate new cells,
                            developing neurological "plasticity" and building up a functional reserve that provides a
                            hedge against future cell loss. <br> <br> Any mentally stimulating activity should help to
                            build up your brain. Read, take courses, try "mental gymnastics," such as word puzzles or
                            math problems Experiment with things that require manual dexterity as well as mental effort,
                            such as drawing, painting, and other crafts. </p>
                        <h2>Control your emotions</h2>
                        <p>People who are anxious, depressed, sleep-deprived, or exhausted tend to score poorly on
                            cognitive function tests. Poor scores don't necessarily predict an increased risk of
                            cognitive decline in old age, but good mental health and restful sleep are certainly
                            important goals.</p>
                        <h2>Socialize</h2>
                        <p>Research shows that an active social life helps reduce your risk of developing dementia,
                            including Alzheimer's disease. The theory is that social connections help keep the
                            connections between your brain cells (neurons) strong.</p>
                        <h2>Exercise</h2>
                        <p>Exercise appears to slow age-related brain shrinkage and maintain the cognitive abilities
                            that diminish with age.</p>
                        <h2>Sleep</h2>
                        <p>A key way to keep your brain working is shut it off for 7-9 hours a night. </p>
