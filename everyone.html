                    <p> Just like your body, the brain ages and deteriorates with time. One thing less known is that its
                        aging begins around the age of 30, and the changes are often irreversible. Brain aging is not a
                        process that can be stopped, but it is one that can be delayed by various methods. This website
                        aims to inform about the ways you can take care of your brain and keep it healthy a longer time.

                        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
                        <p>The brain is one of the most important organs in our body. Despite that fact people don't
                            usually think about keeping it healthy or when they do it's too late and there isn't much
                            left to do. In this section you will find basic information about the brain, since birth to
                            60's. </p>
                        <h2>Development of the brain:</h2>
                        <h3>Infants</h3>
                        <p>Because the brain is an organ that does not regenerate and our goal is to keep ourb brain
                            younger as long as posbbile, we must build on a stable base. <br><br> Brain development
                            begins 20 days in the pregnancy phase. The mothers are encouraged to include more folic acid
                            in their diets, because the folic acid helps the nervous system develop. </p>
                        <h3>Children</h3>
                        <p>Usually children have two times more synapses than adults, meaning they can absorb
                            information at a higher rate. In this phase of brain development, the parents are encouraged
                            to leave their children explore the environment directly and not through a screen, even if
                            the program they are watching is educational. Active information gathering is much more
                            important than the passive one. </p>
                        <h3>Teenagers</h3>
                        <p>At this age, the brain reached it's adult size but its remodelling did not stop. How
                            teenagers spend their time is crucial to brain development and the most important things
                            they should do are: positive behaviour, good thinking skills, get lots of sleep, think about
                            things more abstractly and understand that issues aren’t always simple, think more
                            logically. </p>
                        <h3>20's</h3>
                        <p>The regions in the frontal lobe that are responsible for judgment, planning, weighing risks
                            and decision-making finally finish developing. A twenty-something’s brain has reached its
                            peak in terms of performance. </p>
                        <h2>Brain Aging:</h2>
                        <h3>30's</h3>
                        <p>This is the age when people start to feel that the brain does not regenerate and no new
                            neurons are created. It becomes harder to learn new things and to remember names and
                            numbers. It becomes important to maintain friendships, balance work and home, find time to
                            relax. </p>
                        <h3>40's and 50's</h3>
                        <p>Doing stuff that we find challenging becomes important. Stepping out of our confort zone
                            makes the brain more active. Mental abilities and reasoning skills decline. On the upside,
                            other measures of cognition, such as moral decision-making, regulating emotions and reading
                            social situations have been shown to improve beginning with middle age. </p>

                        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
                        <p>When it comes to brain health, there's a simple set of rulles for everyone.</p>
                        <h2>Avoid smoking, drinking and taking drugs</h2>
                        <p>Brain scans revealed that current and former smokers had a thinner cortex than those who
                            never smoked. The cortex is where important thought processes such as memory, language and
                            perception occur. <br><br> According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and
                            Alcoholism, most heavy long-term alcohol users will experience a mild to moderate impairment
                            of intellectual functioning as well as diminished brain size. <br><br> Drugs can alter
                            important brain areas that are necessary for life-sustaining functions and can drive the
                            compulsive drug use that marks addiction. </p>
                        <h2>Protect your head</h2>
                        <p>Moderate to severe head injuries, even without diagnosed concussions, increase the risk of
                            cognitive impairment. </p>
                        <h2>Improve your diet</h2>
                        <p>Good nutrition can help your mind as well as your body. For example, people that eat a
                            Mediterranean style diet that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts, unsaturated oils
                            (olive oil) and plant sources of proteins are less likely to develop cognitive impairment
                            and dementia. </p>
                        <h2>Mental stimulation</h2>
                        <p>Through research with mice and humans, scientists have found that brainy activities stimulate
                            new connections between nerve cells and may even help the brain generate new cells,
                            developing neurological "plasticity" and building up a functional reserve that provides a
                            hedge against future cell loss. <br><br> Any mentally stimulating activity should help to
                            build up your brain. Read, take courses, try "mental gymnastics," such as word puzzles or
                            math problems Experiment with things that require manual dexterity as well as mental effort,
                            such as drawing, painting, and other crafts. </p>
                        <h2>Control your emotions</h2>
                        <p>People who are anxious, depressed, sleep-deprived, or exhausted tend to score poorly on
                            cognitive function tests. Poor scores don't necessarily predict an increased risk of
                            cognitive decline in old age, but good mental health and restful sleep are certainly
                            important goals. </p>
                        <h2>Socialize</h2>
                        <p>Research shows that an active social life helps reduce your risk of developing dementia,
                            including Alzheimer's disease. The theory is that social connections help keep the
                            connections between your brain cells (neurons) strong. </p>
                        <h2>Exercise</h2>
                        <p>Exercise appears to slow age-related brain shrinkage and maintain the cognitive abilities
                            that diminish with age. </p>
                        <h2>Sleep</h2>
                        <p>A key way to keep your brain working is shut it off for 7-9 hours a night. </p>

                <p>Just like your body, the brain ages and deteriorates with time. One thing less known is that its
                    aging begins around the age of 30, and the changes are often irreversible. Brain aging is not a
                    process that can be stopped, but it is one that can be delayed by various methods. This website aims
                    to inform about the ways you can take care of your brain and keep it healthy a longer time.</p>
